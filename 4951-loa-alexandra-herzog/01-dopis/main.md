Respectable workers of the NYC City Administration, 

The Pirate Party Group in the Prague City Assembly had Alexandra Herzog as its own intern between 8th June 2015 and 28th July 2015. We have found her activity in our office resourceful, despite the fact that English is not the official language of the city administration here in Prague. Her tasks were related to the evaluation of the city infrastructure from a non-native point of view and addressing gaps in current policies of the City of Prague related to tourism and transportation.

As you might know, Prague – as the capital of the Czech Republic – is an antique city, attracting 6 million tourists every year. It is of upmost importance for the city administration to have a good overview of its own transport network, accommodation capabilities, information services and security services not only from its own perspective, but also from someone from abroad. Alexandra was in touch with various tourists and interviewed them directly on what is working well and what does not. She made a detailed study on the comparison of infrastructure in Prague and New York City. Thanks to her our group was able to define issues that were later discussed in the Prague Assembly and addressed by the city administration. These were related mostly to the state of knowledge of English in the city center, the state of transportation from the airport to the center, that prove to be rather challenging for new coming tourists, or the fact that tram network of Prague – no matter how modern and useful – is difficult to navigate for foreigners. 

Alexandra also visited the City assembly meeting to see how democratic decision-making works in action. On 17th and 18th July 2015 she also participated on the 1st Annual Pirate Party of the European Union (PPEU) meeting that took place in Brussels, Belgium. 

My personal experience with Alexandra is very positive, and I would hereby like to recommend her to a corresponding position in the New York fellowship program.
